A lightweight Flask app that automates your browser to scour the web for **emails, phone numbers, and social handles** ‚Äî then streams the results to you in real time. Perfect for founders, recruiters, sales teams, and curious hackers who need fresh contacts **now** rather than **sometime next week**.

## ‚ú® Key Features

| ‚ö° Feature | üöÄ What It Delivers |
|-----------|--------------------|
| **Live browser automation** | Chrome/Edge driven by [Browser-Use](https://docs.browser-use.com) with smart retries and captcha handling |
| **Instant progress feed**   | WebSocket logs update as each page is parsed‚Äîno more staring at a loading spinner |
| **LLM-assisted parsing**    | LangChain + OpenAI extract structured contacts from messy HTML |
| **Deduped contact vault**   | Normalizes contacts and stores them in a local `contacts.json` file to avoid duplicates |
| **Secure secrets**          | User-provided API keys (e.g., for OpenAI) are encrypted using Fernet (AES in CBC mode with HMAC) from the `cryptography` library. The master encryption key is stored locally in `.api_key`, and the encrypted user API key is stored in `.encrypted_api_key`. Both files are correctly listed in `.gitignore` to prevent them from being committed to version control. Decrypted keys are held in memory only when actively being used by the application. |
| **Retro Win-95 UI**         | Pixel-perfect buttons, gray panels, and a splash of neon green for that _dial-up_ vibe |
